            <h2>My Ultimate Goal</h2>
            <p>As a member at Islamic Development Bank, I hope to bring some favorable changes.As the IsDB is working  with the goals of SDG,the members are very much eager working to their respective regions to achieve goals by 2030.</p>
            <h2>Work to Change</h2>
            <p>I do not believe in saying rather than working myself. Because, when people see someone doing something
                good, they also get inspiration to do that. But when you say even your most close person to do something
                new, he/she might not like that. So here goes a saying:
            <blockquote><q>Change Yourself Before You Change the World</q></blockquote>
            </p>
            <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
            <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                efficient. I didn't stop with the web,I went beyond with most popular Javascript Framework called Vue
                JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

            <h3>Project Development</h3>
            <p>The first ever project for a client. It was so nervous moment of my life as a first job. So,this is the
                project from where I got inspiration for later times.</p>

            <h3>Business Growth</h3>
            <p>After trained from Programming Hero, I worked for many clients. But later I understood that I could do
                something on my own. So I started my own business online. </p>

            <h3>Broadcasting the Business</h3>
            <p>To broadcast the business, I had to take help online. So I had to make those above projects to get a good
                position in the online marketing.</p>
